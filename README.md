📏 Instrumentation and Measurement - Term Project
Investigating the Effect of Cutting Speed, Feed Rate, and Tool Wear on Surface Roughness
📌 Project Overview
This project explores how key machining parameters—cutting speed (Vc), feed rate (f), and tool wear (VB)—affect surface roughness in turning operations. Surface roughness plays a crucial role in machining quality, performance, and wear resistance. The study aims to analyze and predict roughness values using MATLAB-based computational models, enhancing machining process optimization.

🎯 Scope of the Study
We focus on two essential roughness parameters:

Ra (Arithmetic Mean Roughness): Measures the average deviation of peaks and valleys from the mean surface level.

Rz (Mean Peak-to-Valley Height): Captures the total height difference between the highest peak and lowest valley within a sampling length.

By evaluating the impact of machining parameters on Ra and Rz, we develop a MATLAB-based predictive model to optimize turning processes.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Analyze the influence of cutting speed, feed rate, and tool wear on surface roughness.
✅ Utilize MATLAB for data processing, regression analysis, and machine learning-based roughness prediction.
✅ Develop an empirical and computational model for machining process optimization.
✅ Validate findings against theoretical and experimental models for accuracy.
