Project Overview
This repository contains the Instrumentation and Measurement Term Project, where we investigate the relationship between cutting speed (Vc), feed rate (f), and tool wear (VB) with surface roughness in a turning operation. Surface roughness is a key metric in machining that directly influences the mechanical performance, wear resistance, and overall quality of machined components. Understanding how machining parameters affect roughness is crucial for optimizing manufacturing processes and achieving superior surface finishes.

Scope of the Project
This study focuses on two widely used roughness parameters:

Ra (Arithmetic Mean Roughness): Measures the average deviation of peaks and valleys from the mean surface level.

Rz (Mean Peak-to-Valley Height): Captures the total height difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley within a sampling length.

By analyzing these parameters under different machining conditions, we aim to develop a predictive model that correlates cutting parameters with surface roughness using MATLAB-based computational techniques.

Key Objectives
✔️ Investigate the effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and tool wear on surface roughness (Ra and Rz).
✔️ Utilize MATLAB for data processing, regression analysis, and machine learning-based roughness prediction.
✔️ Develop an empirical and computational model to optimize machining conditions for improved surface finish.
✔️ Validate results against experimental and theoretical models to ensure accuracy and reliability.
